# Performance Optimizations

## Implemented Optimizations

1. **Font Loading**
   - Configured Inter font with `display: "optional"` for better LCP
   - Added proper font fallbacks and preloading
   - Removed unused SF font faces

2. **Image Optimization**
   - Replaced `img` tags with Next.js `Image` component
   - Added proper sizing and quality attributes
   - Implemented lazy loading for below-the-fold images
   - Added error handling with fallback images

3. **Critical CSS**
   - Moved critical CSS to the top of the file
   - Deferred non-critical animations
   - Added `will-change` for optimized animations
   - Added reduced motion support

4. **Semantic HTML**
   - Improved heading hierarchy (h1 for main page headings)
   - Added proper ARIA attributes
   - Optimized section structure

5. **Next.js Optimizations**
   - Enabled Turbopack for faster development builds
   - Added proper image optimization
   - Implemented proper meta tags and viewport settings

## Next Steps for Further Optimization

1. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Set up real user monitoring (RUM)
   - Configure Core Web Vitals tracking
   - Set up performance budgets

2. **Additional Optimizations**
   - Implement code splitting for larger components
   - Add service worker for offline support
   - Optimize third-party scripts
   - Consider implementing ISR for dynamic content

3. **Testing**
   - Test on various devices and network conditions
   - Run Lighthouse audits
   - Verify accessibility improvements

## Monitoring

Regularly check:
- Web Vitals in Google Search Console
- Real User Metrics (RUM) data
- Error tracking for any regressions
